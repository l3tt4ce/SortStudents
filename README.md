#Programming Project: Sort Students

* Exercise concerning sorting and searching taken from the book Building Java Programs: A Back to Basics Approach
* // Write a program that processes a data file of student's course grade data. The data arrive in random order, each line stores information about a student's last name, first name, student ID, percentage grade, letter grade.
* // Your program should be able to sort the data by any of the columns. Use Comparators to achieve the sort ordering. Make the data sortable by last name, student ID, grade percentage, in ascending order and descending order.

# Important Note:
* I am a student as well, so to other students, please do not copy this. Try it out yourself first! But if you do copy/paste, your professor will probably notice...
